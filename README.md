Personal research- and passion project.
I apply ML-models and concepts for the purpose of creating an (effective or not so effective) algorithmic trading strategy, based on discovering price-action patterns in financial data.
I also have a section where I optimize for the best possible asset portfolio, based on measures of risk (such as volatility and downside risk).
